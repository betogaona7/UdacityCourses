# Udacity courses 
This repository contains exercises of some free courses that I have taken on the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) platform.

### ICS - Intro to Computer Science (cs101)
In the [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) I developed different programs, but the most insteresting one was to understand and progressively develop a search engine. 

### LAR - Linear Algebra Refresher Course (ud953)
Like the name says, the [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/linear-algebra-refresher-course--ud953)  served me as a refresher on the basics of linear algebra. I developed several programs to solve some concepts.

### PFWP - Programming Foundations with Python (ud036)
This [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036) helped me to reinforce my knowledge in object-oriented programming. At the end I developed a catalog of movie trailers website.
